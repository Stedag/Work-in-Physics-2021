# Work-in-Physics-2021

Information for the work-seeking undergraduate in physics.

## Freshmen

Welcome to the department of physics at West Chester University of Pennsylvania!

Note that you are welcome to join the "Physics Lounge" Discord group. The Society of Physics students have assembled a great set of resources such as moving the physics book collection into the cloud. There is also tutoring available. This is a good opportunity to practice talking physics and to simply get to know your upper-classmen peers.

Install and experiment with technical software that is included with your tuition. 90% of your science related coding will likely be done in Matlab, Mathematica, and Excell. 5% may be Java/C++/C/Javascript/R/Python. [Citation needed]

## Sophomores

It's a good idea to find learning experiences that you are interested in. These may include conducting research with WCU faculty, participating in REUs, or picking up complimentary skills such as coding, manufacturing, modelling, et-cetera.

**Github is a great tool to gradually get more familiar with. Feel free to fork this repository and update the resources and recommendations provided here. You can then submit pull requests so that your changes are published in the main branch.**

Studying physics offers regular opportunities to develop fluency in dynamic programming (eg. Python/Matlab/Mathmatica/Excel) . Add in some skills with shell-scripting, version-control, and data structures and you may accidentally become a software developer. Students of any major interested in computer science work should see [a similar repository built by CS students](https://github.com/ProjectBarks/jobs-2021).

## Juniors

[Reseach Experiences for Undergrads](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/list_result.jsp) (REUs) are a great source of research experience. Applications are open primarily to Juniors but less experienced students can sometimes get in. We will list tips for your application process here:

  - From the link provided above, export the list of REU sites as an excel file. Then use the filter feature
  - For preparing Letters of Reccommendation.
    - Make sure your reccommenders know you. Try to provide a concise outline of your reasoning/interest in an opportunity as well as your resume.
    - Letter writing can take quite a chunk of professors' time each year. Do what you can to make this work easier by keeping organized.
  - ask peers and professors for advice on your application writing and resume.
  
 We are hoping to provide a modified version of the data exported from NSF which includes new information added from WCU students who are researching these programs for Summer 2021. 
  
 ## Seniors
 
 See [Grad School Shopper](https://www.gradschoolshopper.com/gradschool/) for a list of ~95% of American Physics PhD programs.
 
The Society of Physics Students has compiled all of the data from Grad School Shopper into a spreadsheet. We are hoping to augment this data with more schools and relevent info and make it available here shortly.

We are also working on publishing a type-set version of the Physics GRE exam in leu of taking the exam for grad school admissions. The goal is to make the questions portable, organized, reconfigurable, adaptable to the modern LMS. Above all the goal is to make the problems more useful for future study.
 
 See the [Graduate Research Fellowship Program](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). Students may apply to this program once as an undergraduate senior and once as a grad student.
